The winner of the election will be the candidate winning the most grand electors. \n","\n","Grand electors are attributed at the state level: in each of the 51 states, there is a given number of grand electors to win (roughly, but not exactly, proportional to the size of the state) and the presidential candidate receiving the most local votes wins ALL the Grand Electors in that state.\n","\n","Because the number of grand electors is not exactly proportional to the population, some states can be prioritized to increase the return on investment of the campaign. We assume here there are only 2 candidates, and no history (no trend of certain states to vote for a particular candidate or party). Hence, each vote is equally \"expensive\" to get, but some states grant more grand elector per capita.\n","\n","You are provided with 2 tables: one giving the number of Grand Electors per state, the other the population per state.\n","\n","You are asked to identify the states that should be prioritized to win the election, with a smart but simple algorithm (brute force computation of all possibilities to find the absolute optimum is not accepted, as it would be to computationally expensive). It is ok not to find the overall optimum, we just want a strategy that makes sense.\n","\n","(This is of course a very simplistic view of reality, but it is a nice starting point to play with data and analyze possibilities).\n","\n","First take a few minutes to think about what you need to do. Steps will be suggested hereafter, but a big part of the data scientist's job is to identify the flow of operations when being asked a practical question, so it is important you start exercising on that in addition to programming.\n","\n","Here is what we are suggesting to do: we will rank states by decreasing number of grand electors per capita. The first states in the list will be the most valuable (you get a large number of grand electors by convincing a small number of people to vote for you). We will target all the states at the top of the list until the cumulative sum (also called running total) of grand electors won is larger than half the total number of Grand Electors in the country."],"metadata":{"id":"WCvAXGmdPKM1"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# We will first load the sql extension into our environment\n","%load_ext sql\n","\n","# Then connect to our in memory
